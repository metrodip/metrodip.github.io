On October 11th, 2020, Ali and I celebrated our first year anniversary of our [Harvest](/harvest/).

## Johnny Donuts for Breakfast

Instead of a wedding cake, last year we had a [donut truck](https://www.johnnydoughnuts.com/) roll into our wedding with
fresh donuts. We thought it'd be the perfect breakfast to have for our
first anniversary.

## Hiking in Marin

We love being outdoors, and we love hiking. I proposed to Ali while hiking, and
look, we found a building with a sign with our wedding date on it: "1011".

## Lemony
We planted this lemon tree as part of our wedding ceremony. Look how it's grown
in the past year! It currently as 4 lemons growing on it.
