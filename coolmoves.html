    <h4>2019 Season</h4>

    <p>
        Hi Everyone, and welcome to the 2019 Coolmoves season!
    </p>

    <p>
        We cooled five amazing camp sites in the 2018 season and had many friends and family join along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have been hard at work organizing the upcoming season of Coolmoves and have already made a few reservations.
        As always, we will let you know our upcoming trips so you can get them on your calendars, and then we will
        send out a reminder email to get a final headcount a couple weeks in advance.
        It's first come first served, so be sure to let us know when you know if you want to join.
        We will also email with more reservation dates as they open up later in the summer.
    </p>

    <p>
        New for 2019 is a special addition non-camping, international trip: Mexico will be cooled!
        Thanks to Ali's parents letting us use their timeshare week, we are able to invite folks with us to
        Puerta Vallarta this year.
        You get yourself there, and lodging is taken care of.    
    </p>

    <p>
        Looking forward to seeing many of you again this year, perfecting the perfect s'more,
        and figuring out what nifty new camping gear to purchase along the way.
        <strong>
            Coolmoves!

    <h4>Mt. Diablo: May 5-6, 2018 [COOLED!]</h4>

    <p>Camp Coolmoves had another successful outing this past weekend. We took on the Juniper Campground at Mt. Diablo with Jessie and Matt who learned us that we need to get a hatchet (amongst other things).</p>

    <h5>The Goodness</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Juniper campground is first-come, first-served with which site you get; we got lucky with campsite #17 with an epic unobstructed view of the bay and the sunset.</li>
        <li>We found an Ace Hardware in Lafayette right off the freeway where we were able to buy bundles of wood since the campgrounds at Mt. Diablo didn’t sell them (thanks for the heads up, Jessie!).</li>
        <li>Jessie made a yummy “Hobo Dinner” for us, and Ali brought some pre/pro-biotic coleslaw that was a great compliment to it.</li>
        <li>In the morning, we drove up to the summit to see a panoramic view of both the Bay and the Central Valley.</li>
        <li>Ali and I’s new inflatable mattress was a lifesaver that helped us through the cold night and made a world of a difference: great addition to our pack!</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Things Learned</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Campsite #17 is on a slope; well, at least the picnic area was. A few falls were the cost of a great view!</li>
        <li>We added the word “enantiodromia” to our vocabulary.</li>
        <li>Our "rival camp," The Racoons, stole our Trader Joe’s hot dogs! Grrrr!</li>
        <li>They also got into our fly trap's bait: we hope they were poisoned by it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A great trip!</p>
