## Recap - COOLED!

Camp Coolmoves had another successful outing this past weekend. We took on one night at Bothe-Napa Valley State Park with Kula, who gave us a new use for our tent stakes.

##### The Goodness
* Campsites were very isolated from each other, and we never felt like we had to be quiet at night.
* The facilities were super clean and nice, with toilet paper, running water, and there was even a shower.
* Ali gave me a [Black Diamond Moji Color light](https://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en_US/moji_color-BD620717WHITALL1.html#cgid=lighting&start=13) as a gift, and this was the first chance for us to use it in the wild. It was bright, with a great color, and we could easily hang it up inside our new Big Tent.
* The weather was perfect: not too cold at night, Ali was able to sleep great, and it wasn‚Äôt difficult to get up in the morning.
* Ali had the great idea to get a string of lights. They‚Äôre lightweight and bright. Great on the table to help keep things well lit!
* Watermelon. Yum. üçâ

##### Things Learned
* We tried stopping by Calistoga on our way out at a winery called Tank Garage; they were packed! So we had to end up skipping that adventure.
* So many mosquitoes! I arrived around 6pm, and about 30 minutes later, when Ali arrived, we were in Zika Town. We had a spray, but that seemed to last about 10 minutes until we‚Äôd need to re-spray. It made it extremely difficult to get the camp setup. Once we got the fire started, I think we were able to start smoking them away. So buggy! Need a better solution for this next time.
* Kula is quite the suburban gal who likes paved roads and hates the outdoors.
* We forgot to bring plates, but we were able to eat out of some aluminum trays we had. Oops.
