#### 2019 Season
Hi Everyone, and welcome to the 2019 Coolmoves season!

We cooled five amazing camp sites in the 2018 season and had many friends and family join along the way.

We have been hard at work organizing the upcoming season of Coolmoves and have already made a few reservations. As always, we will let you know our upcoming trips so you can get them on your calendars, and then we will send out a reminder email to get a final headcount a couple weeks in advance. It's first come first served, so be sure to let us know when you know if you want to join. We will also email with more reservation dates as they open up later in the summer.

New for 2019 is a special addition non-camping, international trip: Mexico will be cooled! Thanks to Ali's parents letting us use their timeshare week, we are able to invite folks with us to Puerta Vallarta this year. You get yourself there, and lodging is taken care of.

Looking forward to seeing many of you again this year, perfecting the perfect s'more, and figuring out what nifty new camping gear to purchase along the way. **Coolmoves!**
