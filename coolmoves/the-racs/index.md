Our rival camp: The Racs! Their little human hands harass us in the nights, and
they enjoy sabotaging our peaceful camp fires by stealing our marshmallows and
soiled sponges!

## Sightings

    > "There were muddy pawprints on a tree outside the bank, so we suspect the raccoons climbed the tree to the roof of the bank, and then somehow managed to crawl into the air ducts and fell through the ceiling tiles onto the floor of the bank."
