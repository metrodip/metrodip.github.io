Dear Cool Movers!

Behold! The time has come for the selection and notification of the 2020 Season of COOLMOVES Campsites! As always, we invite you to [cool with us](https://forms.gle/hrRJKsv8Ty19W7DXA).

Please let us know in advance if you would like to cool as space is generally limited.

We’ve picked some new locations as well as we will visit an old and tall favorite.

We will send out reminders for each cooling, but this overview should let you mark your calendars and gird your loins. Get read to ford the river with Camp COOLMOVES in 2020.
